================================= OOP PRE-LECTURE RESEARCH QUESTIONS
---------------------------------------------------------------------


========What is the difference between static and instance methods/variables?=========
INSTANCE METHODS ARE THOSE THAT BELONG TO THE OBJECT
    PROPERTIES DEFINED THROUGH PERSON rick = new PERSON();
            RICK.FIRSTNAME = ....


STATIC BELONG TO THE CLASS AS A WHOLE AND ARE ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE CLASS ITSELF WITHOUT CREATING AN INSTANCE OF THE CLASS



=======What is an instance and what is instantiation?========

INSTANTIATION IS THE CREATION OF A NEW OBJECT FROM THE CLASS WITH "NEW"

INSTANCE IS THE CREATION OF A PROPERTY IN THE GENERAL CLASS FOR THE OBJECT
    class Person {
        public String name;
    }


============What is an object in Java?============


Object - a single location in memory having *state* and *behavior* specified by `properties` and `methods`. Think about software objects in terms of the *nouns* and *verbs* of real business processes.

AN INSTANCE OF A CLASS, HAS PROPERTIES AND METHODS AND ARE INSTANTIATED WITH THE "NEW" KEYWORD

PERSON rick = NEW PERSON();



============What is a class in Java?============
    USED TO DEFINE A CUSTOM TYPE IN JAVA
        A TEMPLATE / BLUE PRINT FOR AN OBJECT TO BE BASED ON UPON CREATION



============What is the difference between a class and an object?============
 CLASS IS THE BLUEPRINT FOR THE OBJECT TO BE CREATED OFF OF
 THE OBJECT IS THE INSTANCE OF THE CLASS CREATED BASED OFF IT'S SET OF TEMPLATE PROPERTIES



============What is a constructor?============
A SPECIAL METHOD CALLED TO CREATE AN OBJECT
CAN BE OVERLOADED AND ACCEPT ARGUMENTS
CALLED WHEN USED WITH THE 'NEW' KEYWORD FROM A CLASS WHEN CREATING AN OBJECT



============What are some additional uses of the ‘final’ keyword?============

WITH CLASSES IT PREVENTS INHERITANCE
ON METHODS IT PREVENTS OVERLOADING
VARIABLES IT PREVENTS CHANGE OR MODIFYING



============What are some uses of the ‘this’ keyword?============
PROVIDED WAY TO REFER TO THE CURRENT INSTANCE OBJECT THAT A CLASS IS DEFINING IN IT'S "BLUEPRINTS"
    USED IN AN INSTANCE METHOD



============What are visibility modifiers?============

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE
PRIVATE DEFINES THE VISIBILITY OF A VARIABLE IN THE CLASS, WHEN USED, REQUIRES A METHOD TO ALLOW
ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION IN THE PRIVATE PROPERTY


============Why use private visibility?============

ENCAPSULATION => PREVENT EXTERNAL CODE FROM BEING CONCERNED WITH THE INTERNAL WORKINGS OF AN OBJECT
